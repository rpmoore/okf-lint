# Foundation

The dependency-free building blocks every `okf-lint` check module and the
orchestration layer import.

## `src/diagnostic.rs`

- `Rule` — enum of every check rule (5 OKF conformance + 5 markdown style),
  in a fixed declaration order. That order is load-bearing: it is the
  tie-break used when two diagnostics land on the same `(file, line)`.
- `Rule::spec_url(&self) -> Option<&'static str>` — the OKF SPEC.md section
  (with anchor) a given OKF rule enforces, e.g. `OkfMissingFrontmatter` and
  `OkfMissingType` both point at `#41-frontmatter`. Returns `None` for the 5
  style rules, since those are project convention rather than OKF-derived —
  the `None` is itself meaningful output (see `src/main.rs`).
- `Diagnostic { line, rule, message }` — one lint finding.

## `src/frontmatter.rs`

- `split_frontmatter(content: &str) -> FrontmatterResult` — detects and
  extracts a `---`-delimited YAML frontmatter block. Returns `None` (no
  block), `Unclosed` (opening `---` with no closing `---`), or
  `Found { yaml_text, body_start_line }`.
- The opening/closing `---` delimiter comparison tolerates a trailing `\r`
  so CRLF-terminated files are detected the same as LF-terminated ones.
- Shared by the concept-document checker and the `index.md` checker, since
  both need the same delimiter-detection logic with different rules about
  what's allowed inside.

## `src/lint.rs`

- `LintError` — the crate's top-level error type (`PathNotFound`,
  `NotADirectory`, `Io`, `InvalidUtf8`). Only a stub in this section; the
  `Io` variant is used by `walk.rs`. The orchestration function
  (`lint_bundle`) that constructs the other variants is added later.

## `src/walk.rs`

- `collect_md_files(root: &Path) -> Result<Vec<PathBuf>, LintError>` —
  recursively collects every `.md` file under `root`, returning root-relative
  paths sorted lexicographically for deterministic diagnostic ordering.
  Dot-prefixed files/directories below `root` (depth > 0) are excluded via
  `WalkDir::filter_entry` — per the planning spec's traversal contract
  (`planning/claude-spec.md` §5, interview Q2), hidden entries like `.git` or
  `.github` are skipped entirely and never descended into (`filter_entry`
  prunes them, so this isn't just a post-hoc filter — it avoids walking heavy
  hidden trees like `.git` at all). `root` itself is never treated as hidden
  even if its own path is dot-prefixed (e.g. a tempdir in tests).
